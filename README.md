Overview
Welcome to my Tidy Tuesday project repository! 🌍✨

This space is dedicated to my journey of learning and growing in the world of data. I'm a beginner in data visualization and storytelling, diving into weekly Tidy Tuesday datasets to sharpen my skills. Using Python, Tableau, and Power BI, I explore data, extract insights, and craft visual stories.

Tools & Techniques
Python 🐍: I’m working with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to learn the ropes of data analysis and visualization.
Tableau & Power BI 📊: Experimenting with these powerful tools to create interactive dashboards, even as I learn the basics.
What You Can Expect
Data Analysis Notebooks 📓: I’m sharing my learning journey through Python notebooks. Expect plenty of exploration, trial-and-error, and growing insights as I get comfortable with data wrangling.
Visual Reports & Dashboards 📈: Beginner-friendly visuals created in Tableau and Power BI—each designed as part of my practice to improve storytelling through data.
Weekly Learning 🔄: This project captures my progress as I explore diverse datasets—from social issues to interesting world trends—every week is an opportunity to learn something new.
Goals of This Project
Build my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization as a complete beginner.
Create simple, yet informative visuals that help me grow in storytelling.
Share my learning experiences to connect with others, get feedback, and inspire fellow beginners who are also navigating the world of data.
Get Involved!
If you’re on a similar journey or just love data, feel free to explore my notebooks and dashboards. Any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration ideas are always welcome—let's learn together and make data fun and accessible for all!
